        Each pair consists of a public key (which may be known to others) and a private key (which may not be known by anyone except the owner).

    TCP
        **Transmission Control Protocol**

    TLS
        **Transport Layer Security**
        Transport Layer Security is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network.
