However, Vulcanexus is an extended ROS 2 distribution which is officially supported in the platforms stated in the `REP 2000 specification <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html>`_.
Thus, building Vulcanexus distribution for these platforms is expected to succeed.
Other platforms not mentioned in the REP 2000 specification may also build successfully and be used.
