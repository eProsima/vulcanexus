However, as ROS 2 is officially supported in the platforms stated in the `REP 2000 specification <https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html>`_, building Vulcanexus for these platforms is expected to succeed.
Other platforms not mentioned in the REP 2000 specification may also build successfully and be used.
