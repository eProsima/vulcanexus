Vulcanexus Releases
===================

Vulcanexus maintains several releases with different support cycles.
Each year, a new Vulcanexus major version is released.
This major versions have a code name composed of an adjective and the name of a volcano, both starting with the same letter, the first of them being **Galactic Gamble** (v1.0.0).
Within the support period of any version, there can be both minor and patch releases that either add new functionalities in a ABI compatible way, or fix possible issues.
Every other year, a long term release (LTS) is released, the first of them being the H version (May 2022).
In between, LTSs a short term release is released which will receive support for a shorter period of time.
