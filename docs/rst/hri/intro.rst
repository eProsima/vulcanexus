Vulcanexus HRI Overview
=======================

**Human-Robot Interaction** (HRI) is a multidisciplinary research field that studies how humans and robots can effectively perceive, communicate, and collaborate.
It encompasses a wide range of domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, emotion recognition, and behavioral modeling.
The central goal of HRI is to enable robots to interact with humans in a natural, safe, and socially acceptable manner.

Vulcanexus provides a set of tools and libraries to facilitate the development of Human-Robot Interaction applications, leveraging the latest capabilities of Fast DDS to smooth the integration of HRI applications within the ROS 2 ecosystem.
This section introduces the key concepts and components of HRI within the Vulcanexus framework.

HRI Components
--------------

Vulcanexus HRI library includes the following components:

- **Face detection**: A module for detecting and recognizing human faces in images and video streams.
- **Human pose recognition**: A module for recognizing human body poses and gestures.
- **Emotion recognition**: A module for recognizing human emotions based on facial expressions and body language.
- **Displays**: A module for rendering visual information on screens and other display devices.
