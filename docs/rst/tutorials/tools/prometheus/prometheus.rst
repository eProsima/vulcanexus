ROS 2 network statistics inspection with Prometheus
===================================================

Background
----------

Vulcanexus integrates `ROS 2 Monitor <https://fast-dds-monitor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, which is a useful tool for monitoring and studying a ROS 2 network as ROS 2 relies on the `DDS specification <https://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/1.4/About-DDS/>`_ to communicate the different nodes.
:ref:`This other tutorial <tutorials_tools_fastdds_monitor>` demonstrates how to use this powerful tool in a ROS 2 `demo_nodes_cpp <https://index.ros.org/p/demo_nodes_cpp/>`_ ``talker``/``listener`` scenario.
However, Vulcanexus Tools offers more possibilities when it comes to statistics visualization; *ROS 2 Monitor* is a frontend application relying on *Fast DDS Statistics Backend*, but the latter may also be leveraged with alternative visualization utilities such as `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io>`_ and `Grafana <https://grafana.com>`_.

This tutorial provides step-by-step instructions on how to monitor a ROS 2 talker/listener in Vulcanexus by using *Fast DDS Statistics Backend* along with *Prometheus*.

Prerequisites
-------------

Vulcanexus Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure that the Vulcanexus installation includes Vulcanexus Tools (either ``vulcanexus-iron-desktop``, ``vulcanexus-iron-tools``, or ``vulcanexus-iron-base``).
Also, remember to source the environment in every terminal in this tutorial.

.. code-block:: bash

    source /opt/vulcanexus/iron/setup.bash

Prometheus exporter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally, `C++ Prometheus exporter <https://github.com/eProsima/prometheus-cpp/>`_ is required to forward the statistical data received by the backend to *Prometheus*.
Install `this <https://github.com/eProsima/prometheus-cpp/>`_ specific version of *Prometheus exporter* by following any of the methods described in the given link.

Prometheus
^^^^^^^^^^

It is recommended (although **not required**) to install *Prometheus* for being able to visualize gathered statistics.
If not installed, data will still be collected and visible in the terminal, but no graphs will be displayed.
Follow the installation guide from the `official website <https://prometheus.io>`_.
The configuration file needed to replicate this demo can be found `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend/main/examples/cpp/ROS2Prometheus/prometheus.yml>`_.

Backend application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It only remains to install a simple `application <https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend/tree/main/examples/cpp/ROS2Prometheus/>`_ that, by making use of *Fast DDS Statistics Backend*, will collect statistical data and export it through the previously installed *Prometheus exporter*.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir ~/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend && cd ~/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend
    git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend.git
    cd ~/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend/examples/cpp/ROS2Prometheus
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. && make


Execute ROS 2 demo nodes with statistics
----------------------------------------

In order to activate the publication of statistical data, `eProsima Fast DDS <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/>`_ requires an environment variable specifying which kinds of statistical data are to be reported.
Consequently, before launching the ROS 2 nodes, remember to set ``FASTDDS_STATISTICS`` environment variable.
Run the following commands in different terminals (remember to source the Vulcanexus environment):

.. code-block:: bash

    export FASTDDS_STATISTICS="HISTORY_LATENCY_TOPIC;PUBLICATION_THROUGHPUT_TOPIC;PHYSICAL_DATA_TOPIC"

    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener

.. code-block:: bash

    export FASTDDS_STATISTICS="HISTORY_LATENCY_TOPIC;PUBLICATION_THROUGHPUT_TOPIC;PHYSICAL_DATA_TOPIC"

    ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

Launch backend application
--------------------------

Once communication between the talker and listener has been established, launch the application for gathering and exporting statistical data to *Prometheus*.

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ~/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend/examples/cpp/ROS2Prometheus/build
    ./ROS2Prometheus

Traces showing the latency and publication throughput should be visible on screen, with an update period of 5 seconds.

Visualizing with Prometheus
---------------------------

Launch *Prometheus* with the given `configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS-statistics-backend/main/examples/cpp/ROS2Prometheus/prometheus.yml>`_ and create a graph for each of the metrics exported (``fastdds_latency`` and ``publication_throughput``).

.. code-block:: bash

    cd prometheus-install-path
    ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
    xdg-open http://localhost:9090

.. note::

    If running Vulcanexus in Docker containers, and if *Prometheus* has been installed in the host's system, it is required to pass ``--net=host`` argument to the backend application container in order to enable communication between them.

*Prometheus* is a versatile open source monitoring system offering seamless interoperability with other analytics and visualization applications such as *Grafana*.

Feel free to further explore the number of possibilities that *Vulcanexus Tools* and *Prometheus* together have to offer.
