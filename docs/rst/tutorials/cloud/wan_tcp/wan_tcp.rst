Communicate distributed scenarios with Vulcanexus framework
============================================================

This tutorial aims to show the user how to recreate a robot deployment in a distributed network with the capability of monitoring, control and tracking through the Cloud.
This way, a series of tutorials are presented that intend to build a complex final architecture step by step, explaining in detail the different steps of the process and the configuration of the different Vulcanexus nodes and WAN communication enabling components.

The following are the tutorials that make up this course on communication in distributed scenarios using the Vulcanexus framework.

1. :ref:`Edge-Cloud communication on WAN <cloud_wan_tcp_edge_cloud_arch_wan_tcp_edge_cloud_arch>`
2. Remote Vulcanexus robot control on a distributed ecosystem
3. dynamic scaling of distributed networks with Vulcanexus
