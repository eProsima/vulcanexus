Vulcanexus VulcanAI
===================

VulcanAI is a library that provides a framework to easily and flexibly create powerful AI applications.
Leveraging LLM capabilities, VulcanAI acts as an intelligent assistant, capable of understanding and
executing complex tasks by decomposing them into manageable sub-tasks in any environment.
VulcanAI is completely compatible with Vulcanexus, and works marvelously to control and even debug ROS 2
robots and applications.

The following VulcanAI tutorials show how to use most of VulcanAI's features, starting from the basics concepts and gradually increasing in complexity until a complete application is built.
