Vulcanexus VulcanAI
===================

VulcanAI is a library that provides a framework to easily and flexibly create powerful AI applications.
Leveraging LLM capabilities, VulcanAI acts as an intelligent assistant, capable of understanding and
executing complex tasks by decomposing them into manageable sub-tasks in any environment.
VulcanAI is completely compatible with Vulcanexus, and works marvelously to control and even debug ROS 2
robots and applications.

A demo of the potential of VulcanAI can be found in the following video:
